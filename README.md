This is a port of a JJ-circuit form Keysight ADS to QUCS based on the report on (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05177). There seems like there is a error in the solver which causes the results in a transient simulation with a voltage step to be incorrect, however it may still be usefull in other applications. For a more extencive description see the pdf file.
